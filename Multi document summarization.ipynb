If you get the project done by your deadline, congratulations, you get your money back. Someone holds on to something of yours that you treasure and returns it only if you complete your task by the designated deadline. Do a little bit of the task, give yourself a little reward. If you procrastinate to avoid a dreaded task, three strategies will help. Reward yourself for doing a dreaded task. Instead I just focus on the task itself without all the emotion or drama.\n",

            "In fact, in one study 250 adults were encouraged to exercise at least one time per week. If you want a 56% boost in the likelihood that you'll stay focused a get a job done, make a plan. Decide what part of this job you can get done within a one hour block of time. You walk into the office today 100% intending to sit down and get right to work on that important task. Another day passes without any progress on your priority task. We're far more likely to accomplish something if we have a concrete plan for when and where we'll do the task. When I get back, I see a file that reminds me I need to talk to Kristin, better give her a call. Predetermine an amount of progress you want to make and then delay all of the more interesting distractions until you're through with that work. Only 35% of those who were tracking frequency managed to stick to their priority without distraction, while people who had concrete plans were 91% successful.\n",

            "In a research study at MIT, people who had no interim deadlines made the most errors on an assigned task and were 12 days late on average. I prioritized the list from one to 50, and I estimated how long each task would take. Another proven strategy for kicking a procrastination habit is to set interim deadlines and tell someone those mid project due dates. Find an accountability partner, or your boss, and commit to partial completion deadlines before the final due date. I found it helpful to use concrete, actionable verbs to describe each task. You see this monstrous task, barreling down the road at you, and you're just paralyzed into complete inaction. So, I changed it to, watch this TED talk, 20 minutes, skim read this book, one hour, schedule a 20 minute interview with this person.\n",

Even if you work from home, get up and get dressed in the morning. Get the job done, and then, if you still have time and energy and you want to improve the work, that's fine. Or if you've been working alone, run ideas by others, which often jump starts those creative juices. Work on a project for only five minutes, just get the ball rolling.\n",

Next steps - \"Procrastination is like a credit card, \"it's a lot of fun until you get the bill.\" If a task is going to take you less than two minutes, just do it right away so that you don't risk stalling on it later. For me, I know I should be more active on my LinkedIn social media so that more people, like you, know about my LinkedIn learning courses. By clearly setting your next steps, you just became eight times more likely to follow through with your intentions. Pick at least one project that would push you to the next level in your work or you career.\n"
